	<h1>Music</h1>
	<p> Music is something I could never live without. <br>
	I use music throughout basically everything in my day. <br>
	I started singing at a young age, and eversince then I just continued singing. <br>
	I took a choir class in middle school but singing didn't really peak until high school. <br>
	I joined an official choir my sophomore year, and loved it every sense. <br>
	Being in choir taught me how to be more confident, and bold and also how to memorize songs quickly. <br>

    One of my favorite artist is <a href="https://youtu.be/sJkaBKHie2o">Jazmine Sullivan</a>
