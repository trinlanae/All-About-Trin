	<h1> Family and Friends </h1>
	<p> My family and friends mean the absolute most to me. <br>
	<br>
	My family has always stood beside me and specifically my sisters comforted me when I felt alone. <br>
	Oftentimes, family is who you see the most and should be your tightest bond but I have noticed as I lived more that I have gained relationships with friends that feel like family. <br>
	<br>
	Having friends you can depend on, and know you can count on them helps you be less stressed and also enjoy life more because you hate those people in your life to make you happy. <br>
