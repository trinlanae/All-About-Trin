	<h1> Theatre</h1>
	<p> I joined theatre at the end of freshman year of high school and the start of sophomore year.<br>
	I fell in love with theatre by watching my school put on a musical called "Working". <br>
	Ever since then I knew theatre was something I wanted to pursue. <br>
	As I began to audition for more plays and musical's that my school hosted. <br>
	My confidence increased tremendously, and also built another family through working with my fellow actors. <br>
