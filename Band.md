# Band
### I joined band my freshman year of high school.
##### Band taught me resilence, hardwork, and to never give up.
##### During marching band season was my favorite part because of all the traveling we got to do , and also the friendship build. 
##### Music was something that always spoke to me so learnning to plan an instrument came natural with some help of my director of course.
##### During my band days I learned how to plan 5 different instruments, clarinet, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone, euphonium, and the french horn.
