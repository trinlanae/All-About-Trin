# Family and Friends
### My family and friends mean the absolute most to me.
##### My family , specifically my sisters and brothers have always stood beside me even when I felt like I didn't have anyone or felt alone. 
##### Often times, family is who you see the most so that should be the tightest bond but I noticed as I lived more that I have gained relationships with friends that feel like family.
##### Having friends you can depend on , and know you can count on helps you be less stressed and also enjoy life more because you have those people in your life to make you happy.
