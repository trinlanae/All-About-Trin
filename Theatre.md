# Theatre
### I joined theatre end of freshman, start of sophmore year.
##### I first fell in love with theatre by watching my school put on a musical called "Working" and every since then I knew theatre was something I wanted to pursue.
##### As I began to audition for more plays and musicials that my school hosted. My confidence became better, and I also built another family through working with my fellow actors.
