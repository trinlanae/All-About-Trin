	<h1>Band </h1>
	<p>I joined the band my freshman year of high school. <br>
	Band taught me resilience, hard work, and to never give up. <br>
	Marching band season was my favorite part of the band because we used to travel and I built long term friendships. <br>
	Music was something that always spoke to me so learning to play an instrument came naturally with some help from my director of course. <br>
	During my band days I learned how to play five different instruments which included : <br>
	<br>
	<strong>Clarinet</strong>
