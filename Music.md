# Music 
### Music is something I could never live without.
##### I use music throughout basically everything throughout my day. 
##### I started singing at young age, and also wanted to keep on proceeding through it.
##### I took a choir class in middle school but didn't peak with my singing until high school.
##### I joined an offical choir my sophmore year, and loved it every sense.
##### Being choir taught me how to be more bold , and learn how memorize songs quickly.
